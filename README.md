#### Team Members:

Joanne Cairns, Jurn Douwes Isema, Lorenzo Gavazzeni, Paul Ginsberg and Susan Mahon (with additional backup resource from Tim Lockie).

#### Project Overview:

Membership Management in NPSP

How to tackle the problem of renewing and changing memberships within Salesforce (subscriptions, recurring donations) 

* Dream Solution which sparked this project
This is further provided within the Documentation folder; the ethos we are going for is a Minimum Viable Product; the "gold standard" area of the market is already supported by commerical products.

* Project Summary
    * What is the project?
    The project is to creatively use existing standard functionality to enable support for Memberships; it is likely that detailed documentation will address this goal. The project will be sanity checking the features and documenting the process so that a New Admin will be able to follow it. A "recipe" in other words.
    
    * What impact will this have on the Community?
    This will remove a major pain point for European nonprofits, who often have to reinvent the wheel.
    
    * How could this project be distributed into the Community? ie, private blog, new How-To Guide, a new or updated existing HUB Article, new Open Source App or Component, etc.
    HUB Article, leading to a Trailhead badge in due course.
    
    * Is this a new project, or one carried over from a prior sprint?
    New project.
    
#### What have you accomplish during this sprint?

* Include links to Docs/Code if applicable
Please see Documentation.

#### What else needs to be done before you can share this project with the Community?

* Tasks that can be worked on by the Community or at a future Sprint
If people wish to liaise on this project please contact Paul Ginsberg. In the first instance we are following Tim Lockie's notes on the suggested way forward (see Documentation folder).

* How can the broader open source Community help to finish this project?
Help with testing, fact finding, and write ups.

* What (if any) help would you like from Salesforce.org in order to share this project with the Community?
In due course, assistance with placing on Power of Us Hub and Trailhead.
